            Hello! My name is <strong>Cynthia Okechukwu</strong>. My life has
            grown tremendously through a deep fascination with learning and
            understanding how things work. I am a professional
            <strong>Quality Assurance Tester</strong>, experienced in testing
            websites and mobile software applications to ensure they are fully
            functional and user-ready before deployment. Driven by my passion
            for continuous growth, I am now learning
            <strong>Backend Engineering</strong> to build a solid foundation in
            automation and software development frameworks. My goal is to master
            backend logic and create innovative, efficient solutions that
            improve everyday life.
